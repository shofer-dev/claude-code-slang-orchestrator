# Slang Orchestrator — benchmark results

## Smoke findings (real-run validation)

### ✅ The executor drives real multi-agent flows

`pipeline.slang` (2 agents, await + routing + output contracts): Producer→`{n:21}` →
Worker→`{doubled:42}`, **converged** in 8.9s, contracts honored. The real
`AgentSdkDispatcher` path works — the thing the 40 unit tests only mock.

### ⚠️ The flagship `implement-feature.slang` does NOT run reliably (as-is)

Run on a faithful shofer **master** worktree (feature: a `formatDuration` util).
**Two real runs, two distinct failures — neither converged cleanly:**

1. **Run 1 — livelock.** The full protocol executed and the *work succeeded*:
   Architect designed it, escalation auto-approved, Developer implemented
   `formatDuration` + 13 passing tests, Reviewer returned **PASS**. But the
   Architect↔Developer **done/accept handshake never closed** — it looped to
   `budget_exceeded` at **round 100**. Deterministic, but a **livelock**, not a clean
   convergence.
2. **Run 2 — agent hang.** Hung at the Architect's `implement` hand-off stake (r2);
   the agent session stalled for the full 15-min timeout (`exit=124`), orphaning
   agent processes.

Plus a clear bug: **the `.slang` `budget: rounds(30)` directive is dead-wired** — the
executor uses `opts.maxRounds ?? DEFAULT_MAX_ROUNDS` (=100) and nothing plumbs the
flow's `budget` in. So the flow ran to 100, not 30.

### The honest thesis correction

The naive claim — "slang = deterministic = reliable" — is too strong, the same way
live-memory's "saves tokens" was. **Deterministic *coordination* is necessary but not
sufficient for reliable *workflows*.** End-to-end reliability also requires:
- a **correct workflow spec** (implement-feature's count-matched done/accept handshake
  is fragile and livelocks here), and
- **robust agent dispatch** (real Agent-SDK sessions are slow and sometimes hang).

The executor's round cap *is* the reliability backstop working as designed — it
terminated deterministically (`budget_exceeded`) instead of hanging forever. But the
workflow did not succeed. A buggy/fragile `.slang` deterministically fails.

### Implication for the benchmark

`implement-feature` is **not benchmark-ready** until its convergence + the budget
plumbing + agent-hang robustness are addressed. The A/B reliability comparison needs a
workflow the **slang arm itself completes reliably**. Recommended: establish the
benchmark on a simpler, reliably-converging multi-agent workflow first (pipeline, or a
fixed single-round review), then return to implement-feature once it's hardened.
